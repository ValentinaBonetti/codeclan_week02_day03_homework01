1. How similar was your plan to the final program?
Did you have to digress from your plan as the program developed?
>
The plan is quite similar to the final result. The only difference is
that, from the customer class, we removed the "update_drunkness" method
and we added the "buy_food" method.


Does each of your classes follow the Single Responsibility principle?
Or are any of your classes doing too much?
>
I think that the classes are quite balanced and do what we would expect
in real life (in terms of responsability).


Did you practice TDD?
>
Yes, we wrote tests before any implementation.


Are each of your methods tested?
Did you find anything difficult to test?
>
Yes (we just didn't test all the variables declared with attr_),
all quite smooth. A bit tricky using objects as keys in ashes, but
we just needed to use the syntax => instead of : and all worked.
